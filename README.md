# GrokIsThisTrue Project

## Overview
GrokIsThisTrue is a Twitch bot built using the Twitchio library. The bot is designed to respond to specific commands in Twitch chat, utilizing Groq functionality for processing queries. This means the bot uses Groq API to simulate messages generated by Grok.
But to be fair, this project was made to make a meme real.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- Git

## Warning
This project requires a Python virtual environment to work properly. The virtual environment itself is not included in the repo, since it depends on system-specific dependencies.
After creating your own virtual environment, install the dependencies from `requirements.txt`.

Note: You may need to remove all `torch` entries from `requirements.txt` and install PyTorch separately, as it may not work out-of-the-box.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd GrokIsThisTrue
   ```

2. **Create a Python 3.10+ virtual environment:**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Twitch bot access token and Groq API key:
   ```
   AccessToken=your_access_token_here
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
   ```

## Usage
To run the bot, execute the following command:
```
python src/bot.py
```
## .gitignore
Make sure your `.gitignore` excludes the `venv/` folder and sensitive files like `.env`. This is especially important if you’re collaborating or plan to publish a fork.
