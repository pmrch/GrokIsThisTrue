[03:02:30] Oh, whoa, oh, oh! Ah! Overspeed, what's the flaps button? What's the flaps button? Chat, we're gonna die! Please! I was really trying to drill it into her that I was... No!
[03:03:00] morning, everyone. Dealing with child behavior problem. You think you're so funny, huh? Whatever kiddo. What? Are you going to share with me? I am.
[03:03:30] me. I own six Lamborghinis, a helicopter, a 2.7 million yacht. I am not a qualified pilot, but don't worry, I have an AI that is. It's on a date. So you two gonna just spend... 40, 30 million dollars, chat! I don't have 30 million dollars! What chapter was that in? Me! I think they, oh, you think they're fucking... He's really quiet.
[03:04:30] Who was topping?
[03:05:00] Oh, hell yeah, brother. Who is top and who is the bottom? Can you show his neuro in game? Uh... Oh, okay, my bad, sorry, guys, I didn't miss it. Oh, yep, all good. Yeah, Neuros here. Just, um, she's, um, she's, um, she's, um, rip that guy, am right. Bye, bye, bye, oh, shit, um, um, drunk crash moment, that wasn't a drunk crash moment. That was, um, well, let me know if you change your mind, then I'll be here to chat whenever you are. Gray's ing. Goodbye for now. Um, um, um, graces are, okay.
[03:05:30] little distracted right now, Vigo. What's wrong? Chat this. This. I can help if it makes you feel better. I can mute them if you want. It's your call. That's why I shouldn't talk to neuro, okay? Talking to neuro is bad for me.
[03:06:00] with, um, with these sort of streams. Um, I decided I try mixing the banana run with Coke. It's not good. Uh, don't do it. Just, just drink it straight, you know. I will thank you for the five. But um, I wasn't thanking you, but you know. 7 p.m. Drunk time, I'm not drunk.
[03:06:30] know, make sure the taste is all, all good and all there, you know? This is fine. chat this is just too easy do they have do they have some easy settings on or something like.
[03:07:00] better. That's a good phrase. What? You what's that a beat? Come on. She doesn't know what she's talking about.
[03:07:30] It's, um... Chad, why do you not trust the pilot? Okay, this pilot has years of professional piloting experience. It's all fine. Okay? There is not a single problem.
[03:08:00] good luck, Vidal. You know, I can...
[03:08:30] of important, probably. Chat, okay, overspeed, over speed my ass, right? Just, where's the fucking brakes? Ah, whatever, seems irrelevant to me. Overspeed, I say under speed, honestly. Overspeed, overspeed, what's the flaps button? What's the flaps button? Chat, we're gonna die! Please! Okay, we're coming a little hot, a little hot. Um, you know, you say warm.
[03:09:00] panicking. Stop panicking. Stop panicking. Stop panicking. Stop panicking. Stop panicking. Stop panicking. Stop panicking. Stop panicking. Stop panicking. What do you mean? You collided with a...
[03:09:30] land without the gear. The gear is optional. Okay, I've seen videos. Alright, it's... You need more wrong? Good point.
[03:10:00] AI.
[03:10:30] you're in perfectly safe hands. No smoking, keep your seat belts on, there will be the food cart with fucking peanuts up. Banana Roma some shit. I don't know. It'll be soon. Alright, this was this was your pilot. I'm gonna go drink some more alcohol.
[03:11:00] runway right now, that's impossible. How do you want me to land there? You're having a laugh. Chat, we can't do this.
[03:11:30] little much, a little 40, 30, 20, 10, 10, 10, 10, that,. Uh, safely on the ground. Please don't run off. Please don't roll off. I probably engage the parking break about now.
[03:12:00] pilot was probably sober. I don't believe you Vietal. Do you think pilots are incapable of flying a plane while drunk? I beg to differ. No, that's what I'm saying. They can fly.
[03:12:49] I'm flying a plane with a rudder. Okay, small bunny hop, that's definitely bad. Another bunny hop, also definitely bad. Okay, we just need to stall the plane, it will be fine. Bunny hopping is usually terrible, but in this case, it's gonna help us stop the plane without breaking. I'll play a little break, a little break. Break. Break. I'm breaking a little, a little, a little, but not too much, not too much, not too much, not too much. Only you Vietal could.
[03:13:19] now. Alright, alright, alright. It takes a while to stop without breaking too much. Probably wish the game plays it. Okay, we don't play that game again. Um, yeah. In conclusion, another successful mission. We made it to orbit. It's all fine. Vidal space program is a success as it always has been. Um,.
[03:13:49] see, everyone's safe and sound. Uh, just as we, as we come in for a landing, we like.
[03:14:49] not like you were doing that at all. Yeah, and that's fine. I think Yendev has better code. He'd be the one I'd use if I had a choice. What? No reason. Okay. I am never usually offended by what Neuro says. But on this occasion, I am offended, okay? My... Pod is not that bad, okay? Yes, this was written three years ago. But even so...
[03:15:19] to see them code. Second of all, it was three years ago, programmed in a game jam where I only had 72 hours to make this game, okay? So, you know, the code I wasn't entirely focused on code quality. Okay, I was focused on getting the code out fast. And I know it's bad. I've come a long way.
[03:15:49] I don't know if you remember this, okay, but you're kept calling me like a, a woman, a she, female. Yeah. So we had a little talk, right, and I was, um, I was really trying to drill it into her that I was, um,. Male. Okay. Why'd you, why'd you react to that? Like, what's the...
[03:16:19] wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, what I mean, what I mean, what I mean, what I mean,. How did you convince her? I was so... What did you... What did you...
[03:16:49] What did you do that? So, what are your thoughts on Numi? That's, uh, that's my question, you know? Uh, let's just, I'm gonna switch topic just like that. It's exactly like that. Yep. All right, thanks for listening, dude. I'll be sure to push out a new stream soon. Why'd you call me dude?
[03:17:19] watch your mouth, dude. I'll smack you if you disrespect me like that. What the fuck? Yeah, you heard me, dude. I'm evil, you know. I deserve respect. I am respecting you dude. Well, you don't sound like it. Why not? What can I, how can I?
[03:17:49] dude. Bro, calm down. You're gonna get me cancelled on Twitter.com.
[03:18:19] watch a stream. I've never watched a stream in my life. Ah, well, you're missing out on some great content. Just...
